This pen is a demo taken from a subsection of [Variable Fonts - An exploration of expressive and performant typography](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/testdrive/demos/variable-fonts/).

This shows how you can utilize variable fonts with IntersectionObserver to give a meaningful response to end users when they scroll into view.
